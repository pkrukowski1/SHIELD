## `target_network`

This module includes implementations of the target network architectures in SHIELD.

- `alexnet.py` – Standard implementation of the AlexNet architecture used as a target network.
- `mlp.py` – Defines a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture suitable for smaller datasets.
- `resnet18.py` – Implementation of the ResNet-18 architecture used for more complex vision tasks.
- `vit.py` – Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture adapted as a target network within the SHIELD framework.
